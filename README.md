NOTE: I was skilled at coding in HTML and CSS in High School, but my time at Binghamton University has taken away from my passion for front-end user development since most classes are focused on the back-end. I am taking this opportunity to not only rekindle my love for the front-end and UX/UI, but also add to it by learning React and JavaScript.

Commit Message Format - "Update X, Title, mm/dd/yy"

Removed update log, as it would become too tedious to log everything. The titles of each should be sufficient.
